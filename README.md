# FAMOUS
FAMOUS is a forensic analysis tool built to triage Android applications and to assist the analyst in the selection of applications for further in-depth or manual analysis. The motivation behind FAMOUS is to overcome the limitations of the signature-based triaging forensic tool. The main functions of FAMOUS is to assign a proper class label (among benign and malware/suspicious) to every selected Android application by underlying classification engine. Each classification engine is built by training and testing different machine learning algorithms on proposed permissionâ€™s score based feature set that is extracted from a large dataset. Currently, in the proof-of-concept implementation, it has only best-performing classifier but it can be easily extended with more classifiers. Screenshots of the main window and result window of FAMOUS are attached for Understanding..
